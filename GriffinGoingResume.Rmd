aboutme: "While studying music as a college undergraduate, I took an introductory computer programming course that opened me up to a whole new world for which I have the greatest passion. Since then, I have been vigorously pursing computer science as a full-time career, taking in every morsel of knowledge I find along the way. Keeping busy with both coursework and passion projects, I've made computer science both my professional mission, and my personal hobby. "

# Projects

## NaviGatr In-Building Mapping Application 

 * Designed and created (with a team) an app for navigating inside buildings via Dijkstra's Algorithm
 * Enabled easy navigation between rooms with visual and written directions 
 * Companion app enabled the creation of maps over any image or floor plan
 
## Conversion of Music to Haptic Vibrations on a Worn Device 
 * Working to compress wave frequency up to 20,000 Hz to a 500 Hz range 
 * New waves sent in haptic form to a wearable device 
 * This method allows those with hearing loss experience music in a new way

# Design Principles and Libraries

## React

- Built a location-based weather service **React** app using the **Bootstrap** library
- Primarily used collaborative information from both coordinate-based and the *National Weather Service* **REST APIs**

## REST API

- Built a front-end client for searching the International Games Database
- Functionality includes: searching the database, selecting a search result, and navigating available selection information
- Client automatically re-queries the API if redirect information is returned

```{R para}
#stuff like React and whatnot, leaving for parameterization down the road
```

# Work Experience

Bonefish Grill, Grand Rapids, MI — Inventory Manager • *February 2016 - August 2020*

 - Oversaw the successful implementation of a new digital payment system
 - Optimized inventory tracking/ordering process to save both time and money 
 - Modified computer workflow assets/processes to increase productivity
