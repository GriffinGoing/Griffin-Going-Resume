aboutme: "While studying music as a college undergraduate, I took an introductory computer programming course which opened me up to a whole new world. A strong self starter, I dove in and began pursuing computer science as a full-time career. I love the ongoing challenge to learn that a career in CS demands, and I am eager to continue my journey. "

# Projects

## In-Building Mapping/Navigation Application 

 * Designed and created (with a team) an app for navigating inside buildings via Dijkstra's Algorithm
 * Enabled easy navigation between rooms with visual and written directions 
 * Companion app enabled the creation of maps over any image or floor plan
 
## Conversion of Music to Haptic Vibrations on a Worn Device 
 * Working to compress wave frequency up to 20,000 Hz to a 500 Hz range 
 * New waves sent in haptic form to a wearable device 
 * This method allows those with hearing loss experience music in a new way 
 
## Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients Dashboard
 * Built an online dashboard for extracting and analyzing MFCC features from .wav files
 * Offers interactive plot manipulation and visualization options
 * Allows users to see extracted features relevant to audio training algorithms in direct juxtaposition
